# SnakeGameDemo
Demo of a snake game used to acclimate me to the advantages and limitations of linked lists.

Please note that this code could be more effiecient in the way it handles the program, however, I limited myself to using on linked lists to create it, as a challenge to myself.
As such, please regard the written code with a grain of salt.

Enjoy the game!
